creating and training a decision tree algorithm to predict how many points a player will score in a given NBA game based on their points per game, injury history, and the defensive rating of the team they will face.

## dataset
I'm using a dataset from Kaggle for ppg, and am currently looking for more refinded data and an API for injury history and enemy team defensive rating respectively.
