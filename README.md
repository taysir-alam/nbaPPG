# nbaPPG
creating and training a decision tree algorithm to predict how many points a player will score in a given NBA game based on their points per game, field goal percentage, and three-point percentage. It may not be completely accurate right now, so I will implement an enemy defensive rating feature, along with a turnover rate feature.  

## dataset
I'm using a dataset from Kaggle for ppg, and am currently looking for more refinded data and an API for enemy team defensive rating. 

check out the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-nba-player-stats-regular

stay tuned!
